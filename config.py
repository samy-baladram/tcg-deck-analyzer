#### Power Index: How We Rank the Best Decks

**Data Source and Limitations**  
The Power Index uses recent tournament data from [Limitless TCG](https://play.limitlesstcg.com/tournaments/completed), specifically the most recent {tournament_count} tournaments. This provides a rolling window of competitive results that adapts as the metagame evolves. Note that this data only includes reported "Best Finish" results, which may represent a subset of all matches played.

**Formula and Methodology**  
The Power Index is calculated as:

Power Index = (Wins - Losses) / âˆš(Wins + Losses)

This formula balances three critical factors:
* Win-loss differential (raw performance)
* Sample size (statistical confidence)
* Recent metagame context (using latest tournament data)

**Advantages Over Alternative Metrics**
* **More robust than Win Rate**: Differentiates between decks with small sample sizes and those with proven consistency
* **More dynamic than Popularity**: Measures actual competitive performance rather than just prevalence in the meta
* **More normalized than Raw Record**: A 20-5 record and a 40-10 record would have different win rates but similar Power Index values, properly accounting for confidence

**Interpretation Guide**
* **Positive values**: Indicate winning records (higher values = stronger performance)
* **Negative values**: Indicate losing records (generally filtered from top displays)
* **Magnitude**: Values typically range from -3 to +3, with top-tier decks usually above 1.0

**Important Caveats**
* The metric is sensitive to metagame shifts and tournament representation
* Limited by the quantity of available tournament data
* Best used as one factor in deck selection alongside matchup analysis and personal play style considerations
